                            Undefined Purpose-
                            Without a defined purpose, the entire educational experience is like a journey without a destination. How do you arrive if you do not know where to go?

                            Irrelevant Curriculum
                            Stagnant Curriculum- Something which is supposed to decode the mysteries of life is outdated. Where is the relevance of education with the world then?

                            Boring Format
                            "Commit it to the memory, vomit it on the paper"- Is that it? Why isn't education as exciting as a game of cricket?

                            Disconnect from life
                            Why do you need to impress B for ball to your child, when you can actually let him learn by playing with one? How can education be so disconnected?

                            Business Driven Approach
                            If quality education is not affordable for all, what good does Right to Education imply?

                            Corruption
                            Just like parenting, teaching is 'seva'. It can't be just a job.
