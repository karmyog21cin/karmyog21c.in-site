                    	<h2>Multi- stages of learning</h2>
                        <p>The OmniDEL<sup>TM</sup> learning programs are designed differently for 4 different stages of learning. Stage 1 is awakening (Jaaagran) which comprises of especially designed JAAAGO programs in the form of concerts, festivals, TV shows and Web-episodes. Once awakened the learners enter stage 2 which is discovery (Jigyasa). The discovery programs consist of lessons designed to feed the curiosity of the learners and help them explore various aspects of the subject being pursued. Once the learner has explored the subject in the discovery stage he/she now enters the 3rd stage which is deep study (adhyaan). The programs in this stage are designed to provide the learners with detailed knowledge (gyaan) & skills (kaushal) on their pursued subject of interest. Having gained the knowledge & skills the learner now enters the 4th and final stage of learning which is committed practice (saadhna). In this stage learners are provided with specially designed tools and techniques to assist them in their practice.</p>
